Moving the Snake 
The Head is moved to the new block 

The Block before the head gets the position where the head used to be
Each block is moved to the position of the block that used to be before it

this deletes the last block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Positive y-values go downward (increasing y moves the object down).
Negative y-values go upward (decreasing y moves the object up).



1. If snake hits itself 
2. If snake hits the walls

Say body block at start  = [4,10]
and head pos at start = [5,10]
(subtract the vectors  = 4-5 = [-1,10])
then first block is to the left of the head
